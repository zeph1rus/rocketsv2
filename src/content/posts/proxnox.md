## Proxnox

Proxnox is a notification forwarder I wrote for OSX/macOS.  Specifically proxnox allows you to forward OSX/macOS notifications to discord webhooks.

This is useful if you're going to be afk and you want notifications about local tasks etc that aren't synced to the cloud (like long encodes etc).

You can get proxnox at [Github](https://github.com/zeph1rus/proxnox/releases)
